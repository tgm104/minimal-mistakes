I am an IT engineer from Finland. Currently studying for my second degree while working. Figured I should create an account on GitHub and use the Pages for a personal portfolio of sorts. The Pages use a Jekyll-based theme called Minimal Mistakes. My future plans are to complete my second degree, move abroad for work and get my Master's Degree someday.
