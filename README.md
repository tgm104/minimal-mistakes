## Usage

For detailed instructions on how to configure, customize, add content, and more read the [theme's documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).

**Note:** Gem version of the theme requires Jekyll v3.3+ and is not currently supported on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can still use the theme with GitHub Pages, you'll just need to install using the old "[repo fork method](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/installation/)".

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

To test the theme, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/test/`. This starts a Jekyll server using content in the `test/` directory. As modifications are made to the theme and test site, it will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.
